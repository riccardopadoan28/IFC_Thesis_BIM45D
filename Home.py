### üîç Main Features

1. **IFC Export Configuration** ‚Äì prepare IFC4x3 export settings and download a JSON configuration.
2. **IDS Creator** ‚Äì author Information Delivery Specification (IDS) rules and export them as JSON or XML.
3. **Validation Tools** ‚Äì validate loaded IFC models against IDS rules and save results for reporting.
4. **Model Health** ‚Äì automated analysis using the IFC4x3 structural dictionary (counts, property-set ratio, simple verdict).
5. **IFC Import & Viewer** ‚Äì upload IFC files and inspect schema, entities and properties.
6. **BIM Collaboration (BCF-like)** ‚Äì dedicated page for exporting validation results as TXT/HTML for issue workflows.

### üß≠ How to Use

- Start with **IFC Export Configuration** to define export behavior and entity filters.
- Use **IDS Creator** to build validation rules; view XML output in the IDS page and export for reuse.
- Upload an IFC via **IFC Import**, then run **Validation Tools** or **Model Health** to analyze the model.
- Export reports from the **BIM Collaboration** page.

### üí° Tips

- Create IDS rules before validating to get meaningful reports.
- Use the Export Configuration JSON to standardize exporters across projects.
- Large IFCs may require time to process; use the Model Health page for quick data-quality checks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Note
This app is built with **Streamlit** and integrates with **IfcOpenShell** and **web-ifc** for IFC processing.
- Regularly clear the cache or restart Streamlit if the app behaves unexpectedly.
- For optimal performance, use the latest version of Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
- Remember: this is an OpenBIM platform ‚Äî everything is meant to stay interoperable and transparent.
