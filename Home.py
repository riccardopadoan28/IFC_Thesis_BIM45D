### üîç Main Features

1. **IFC Export Configuration** ‚Äì Set up and save export settings for your IFC through the creation of a JSON file.  
2. **IDS Creator** ‚Äì Create and manage Information Delivery Specification (IDS) rules for IFC data validation.  
3. **Validation Tools** ‚Äì Verify IFC files against IDS rules to ensure compliance.  
4. **IFC Viewer** ‚Äì Upload and visualize IFC models in 3D directly in your browser.  
5. **Dynamic Property Mapping** ‚Äì Automatically map IFC properties based on your configurations.  
6. **Model Inspection** ‚Äì Explore and analyze the properties and quantities of your IFC models.  
7. **Create Project timeline** ‚Äì Create project schedules directly IFC model for 4D simulations.  
8. **Draft Bill of Quantities** ‚Äì Extract quantities and measurements from your IFC models for cost estimation.  
9. **Export to Excel** ‚Äì Export your configurations, rules, and model data to Excel for further analysis.  
10. **Reports** ‚Äì Generate reports summarizing your model and rule information.  
11. **User-Friendly Interface** ‚Äì Navigate through the app with an intuitive and easy-to-use design.

### üß≠ How to Use

- Use the **sidebar navigation men√π** to move between different pages of the application.  
- Each page corresponds to a `.py` file in your `/pages` directory.  
- Any updates or rules you create are automatically stored and can be exported for reuse.

### üí° Tips
            
- Start with IFC Export Configuration to define your export rules before creating or validating models.
- The IDS Creator and Validation Tools work best together ‚Äî create your IDS rules first, then validate your IFC models against them.
- Keep IFC file names short and descriptive (e.g., Structure_Model_IFC4.ifc).
- Large IFC files (>100MB) may take longer to load ‚Äî consider simplifying your model first.
- When exporting, check that your property sets (Psets) and quantities (Qto) are properly mapped in your configuration.
- Keep your browser window wide open for the best display experience.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Note
This app is built with **Streamlit** and integrates with **IfcOpenShell** and **web-ifc** for IFC processing.
- Regularly clear the cache or restart Streamlit if the app behaves unexpectedly.
- For optimal performance, use the latest version of Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
- Remember: this is an OpenBIM platform ‚Äî everything is meant to stay interoperable and transparent.
