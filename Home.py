### üîç Main Capabilities

1. IFC 4x3 Export Configuration ‚Äî prepare and export IFC4x3 settings.
2. IFC Import & Viewer ‚Äî upload and inspect schema, entities and properties.
3. IDS Creator ‚Äî author and export IDS rules (JSON / XML).
4. BCF  exports, issue reporting and customizable PDF/HTML reports.
5. Validation & Model Health ‚Äî run IDS validations and automated health metrics.
6. 3D Viewer ‚Äî visualize IFC models with xeokit WebComponents.
7. Property & Quantity (QTO / BOQ) ‚Äî extract properties, map property sets and export take-offs.
8. Scheduling (4D) ‚Äî link elements to activities and create time-based sequences.
9. Cost Estimation (5D) ‚Äî apply unit rates to QTO/BOQ and generate cost breakdowns.

Additional features:

- Templates & presets for exports, IDS rules and pricing tables.
- Batch processing and integration APIs for external systems.
- Multiple export formats (CSV, XLSX, JSON, XML) and session/cache management for large models.

---
### üí° Tips

- Create IDS rules before validating to get meaningful reports.
- Use the Export Configuration JSON to standardize exporters across projects.
- Large IFCs may require time to process; use the Model Health page for quick data-quality checks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Note
This app is built with **Streamlit** and integrates with **IfcOpenShell** and **xeokit WebComponents** for IFC processing and visualization.
- Regularly clear the cache or restart Streamlit if the app behaves unexpectedly.
- For optimal performance, use the latest version of Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
- Remember: this is an OpenBIM platform ‚Äî everything is meant to stay interoperable and transparent.
